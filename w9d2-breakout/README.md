<!-- Marvel vs Capcom -->

Model - View - Controller

Model => Concept, idea
Controller => How you should interact with that concept
View => A way to interact with the controller actions

dbHelper => interact with the concept (model-ish)
callback in routes => controller
view => ejs templates

Model: URL
Controller actions: Create, Read, Browse, Delete
EJS templates: call one of the actions
